CAM::EmailTemplate::SMTP

"CAM" stands for Clotho Advanced Media, www.clotho.com, which
supported most of the development of this module.  Contact us at
cpan@clotho.com.

This module alters the CAM::EmailTemplate mail delivery mechanism to
use raw SMTP delivery (via Net::SMTP) instead of relying on the
sendmail binary program.  This module is useful for machines which are
not configured to do their own mail delivery.  Instead, the programmer
or user specifies a mail server to use as the delivery agent.

Install via the usual:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

To get the full effect of testing, please specify a recipient email
address and mailhost:
  setenv RECIPIENT user@foo.com
  setenv MAILHOST mail.foo.com

To take advantage of Net::SMTP's debugging capabilities, use this:
  setenv SMTPTemplate_Debug 1

"COPYING" for details.

This module most closely resembles Mail::Send with the smtp
option.  It has the following advantages:
  * Integration of templating
  * Ability to manually customize the presentation of the mail headers
    (this is the reason why I use Net::SMTP instead of Mail::Send on
    the back end -- Mail::Mailer::rfc822 hardcodes too much)
and the following disadvantages:
  * Only supports SMTP delivery (but see also CAM::EmailTemplate)
  * Doesn't offer an easy-to-understand API for building the header
  * Fewer mail delivery options

This module can be extended to use alternate templating syntax just
like CAM::EmailTemplate.  See the example in the README for that
module, and just append "::SMTP" to all instances of
"CAM::EmailTemplate".
